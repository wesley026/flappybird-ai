Challenges: Masking, pixel perfect collision (look at pygame docs)
Mask for the top pipe and bottom pipe
if these pixels are overlapping
point of

Neural Networks
Input Layer - information to our network
Top pipe and bottom pipe
Output Layer - Jump? represented in neural layer

1. Use connections and weights (how strong the connection is)
2. Use weighted sum to get output
3. Add Bias to adjust the network to the right dimensional space
   F = Activation function ; using tanh here

NEAT - Neural
